# Custom ligature icons font
Custom font with extended character set and icons invoked through ligature replacement of their spelled out names

## Roadmap
### Choose and setup font designer tool
http://www.glyphrstudio.com/

### Implement automation to generate files on push
Automatically generate svgs for a subset of the font (icons only, excluding alphabetical characters) and store them in a dedicated SVG /dist directory.

Also generate a simple webpage or pdf of the characters and their key-mapping to simplify the archiving and searching of icons and their spelled out names.
Webpage should implement a simple search function and a grid display similar to font explorers.
